### VisitorFrame

# Company Reception GUI

Company Reception is a powerful visitor management software developed as a final project for an advanced programming course. This software is a testament to the commitment, collaboration, and refined coding skills from a team of ambitious university students, keen on demonstrating a GUI final project thats codded in java and has a dalabase set up in sql.

Written in Java, this software adopts advanced programming concepts like data encapsulation, inheritance, graphical user interface, and inner classes, besides leveraging SQL database to store and manage visitor data efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Visitor**: Enables adding a new visitor along with their photograph.
- **Modify Visitor**: Allows searching for a visitor by their ID and modify their information.
- **Display Visitor History**: Displays a visitor's history in an easy-to-read format using JTable.
- **Today Report**: Generates a detailed report of all visits on the current date.
- **Help Contents**: Provides a comprehensive guide to using the program.
- **About**: Gives information about the hardworking team behind this project.

## Database Setup

One of the key challenges and learning experiences during this project was setting up and integrating an SQL database. The team successfully designed a robust and scalable database structure, essential for storing and retrieving visitor information and enhancing the overall functionality of the software. A snapshot of the SQL database perfectly illustrates how visitor data is captured, organized, and updated in real-time through the Java application interface.

## Usage

The program is initiated by creating a new instance of the `VisitorFrame` class.
